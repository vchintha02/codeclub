# Template: CodeClub Week1 Project

In https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/ you can see that there are many other properties of the request which you can access.

Using the examples shown here, and the Request documentation, update your Hello Worker template so that is gives a different response for requests with a POST method.
Bonus points if you make it response in a JSON format, as is often useful for POST requests
